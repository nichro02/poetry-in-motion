# PROCESS

## PLANNING
I drafted an [ERD](https://lucid.app/invitations/accept/d7c024b2-cd71-4133-8911-fe77740f03fa) and [wireframe](https://lucid.app/invitations/accept/6d4e680a-a358-4995-94b2-7752a3042411) before writing any code in order to make sure I had a clear understanding of what models I needed to include in my app, how they related to each other, and what I wanted my app to ultimately look like.
